## What's inside?
  
A Docker image that packages all the enviroment dependencies for a stack and is necessary when a workspace is started.
This sidecar provides Java, Node, Zowe, and other tools necessary to successfully run a workspace with the Wazi Developer for Workspaces stack. When a user creates and starts a workspace using the Wazi Developer for Workspaces stack, then a Wazi CodeReady Workspaces Sidecar container provides a user runtime for the stack.
